This is an example to showcase the principle of curse of dimensionality.
In high-dimensional spaces, volumes concentrates on the outside exponentially, as the dimension increases.
Hypercubes:
d = 1 => interval
d = 2 => square
d = 3 => cube
and so on.
Hypercube's volume = l^d where d is the number of dimensions and l is the edge length

Side length = 1 => hypercube is an interval
Dimension, d = 50
Volume of hypercube = 1^50 = 1

Boundary is defined to be (0,0.05) and (0.95, 1) 
So, whatever lies between 0.05 and 0.95 doesn't fall within the boundary
Length of non-boundary region = 0.95 - 0.05 = 0.9
Volume of the non-boundary region = 0.9^50

Proportion of the points in a hypercube of dimension 50 are in the boundary = 1 - 0.9^50 = 99.48%
