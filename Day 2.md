-  Simple Regression model to predict sales based on three mediums namely, TV, Radio and Newspaper -
 Model: Sales $\approx$ f(TV, Radio, Newspaper)

 Sales: Variable Y, Response/Target we wish to predict/model.
 TV: one of the features or inputs or predictors X_1
 3 predictors: $\vec{X} = \begin{bmatrix} X_1 \\\ X_2 \end{bmatrix}$
